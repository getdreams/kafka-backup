# Kafka Backup

Kafka Backup is a tool to back up and restore your Kafka data
including all (configurable) topic data and especially also consumer
group offsets. To the best of our knowledge, Kafka Backup is the only
viable solution to take a cold backup of your Kafka data and restore
it correctly.

Backing up Kafka is not trivial. Apart from `kafka-backup` there is
(to the best of our knowledge) no reliable and data-saving way to
backup data from Kafka that also ensures the backup and restore of
consumer offsets.

It is architected as two connectors for Kafka
Connect: A sink connector (backing data up) and a source connector
(restoring data).

Currently `kafka-backup` supports backup and restore to/from the file
system.
